# Lore Ideas around the Time Loop idea

So the main idea is that the world is "stuck" in a time loop where most of the things from the previous loop come back in some way. This helps explain how Kon's can keep fighting amoungst themselves, how lesser kons can come back, and maybe even how the power is actually to move things between loops. Atoms from the loop can be manipulated by specific people and they can bring things back from other Loops.

## Magic changes

Kon's can manipulate looped atoms is really interesting. It also makes the name AtomsPast make a lot more sense (as a side note).

So Kon's can manipulate looped atoms into things they were a part of from past loops? Or that "looped" atoms are maliable by Kon's into whatever the Kon really wants

- Maybe it's both? Kons can manipulate atoms that have been looped how they want to, but it is the easiest for them when those atoms were a part of what they want to make in the past.
  -- This is really cool cause it explains the dice rolls for spells - The Kon doesn't know what atoms of the spell they are casting will be easier to or harder to manipulate depending on if they have been what they want to make for a long time.

## Loop Fights

One of the ideas in my head was that Kon's could start to remember things from past loops - which means they could have long standing rivalries with people. The idea that Kon's can remember past loops also helps with the creation of factions.

- What if they can only remember the LAST Loop?? so they only know what happened (or most of what happened) in the last loop.

- This leads to some interesting options for betrayals/ perceived betrayals

## Factions

If Kons can remember past loops or the last loop (Loop Fights above) then the forming of factions that persist between loops makes sense. Kons are the most powerful things on the planet - they get in charge most of the time cause of their power and form their factions around their philosophies.

Most Kon factions are build around the ideas of how to "defeat the loop"/"destroy the loop".

- Why? Why do they want to destroy the loop?
  -- They know they die. None of them can see past a certain point in the loop and they all remember how they die - but they are back

## Ephermara

### Kons can only remember the last loop - not loops past that

Random thoughts - the remembering yourself in the last loop could have some interesting characters to it. What about a female kon who was with the more "evil reanimation + tech to get things done" faction, well she found herself raised by very caring creatures in the forest until she could get her memories back - and once she did get them back she is horrified about the evils the x faction do to try and get their way and wants to protect instead of destroy

- the "evil" faction could have a goal like many other factions of "defeating the loop". They all know about the loop and

- A man who has Kon powers but does not or can not remember the past loop. Some say it is a sign of the last loop - others say he is lying to get power and fame - others worship him has a new infant god that will destroy the loop. He has gotten very powerful and is in charge of a large nation using mostly technology and disciplined ranks of soldiers. Get a nasty Emperor of Mankind vibe from the dude. The nation he runs at first glance seems to be the "good guys" but they do some terrible things

Maybe one of the "end times" signs is that the Kon's are remembering more and more of their past loops. This is happening on a world level and so Kons are getting stronger and stronger as they remember more and continue to gain power/train up their power past the levels of the last loop. So there is an explosion of technology and power (perfect for a horrific war setting where everyone thinks only they can stop the loop) but not enough energy or infastructure to support it. So the fight over land, rivers, whatever to get enough power to use (and even create) these incredible technologies is so important. (Somewhat of a starcraft vibe - protoss are super techy, but they are up against the organic zerg that have zero tech). There are Kons who think the use of this technology is what causes the Loop. They could think this for many ways like nuclear war, someone gains knowledge of manipulating time, etc.

### Questions

The digging for knowledge and the world discovering more and more that there was a "past loop" and what that means is interesting. Do people just think there has been one loop? If they can remember most of their past loop then many of them will have found some knowledge in the past loop. How is past loop knowledge gathered and shared. Especially how technology is shared.

Does everyone want to try and stop the loop? there should be at least 2 factions who think the "Uniting" the world under their order will stop the loop - like everyone being unified means no war and they think all the bloodshed is what fuels the loop. So spill blood to end blood spill?
