# AtomsPast Rules

## Welcome to AtomsPast

> The goal of AtomsPast is to give you a sandbox to use any miniature you like and
> play a fun, tactical, and customizable game with your friends. This is a labor of love
> to meld my favorite aspects of other great games into something I personally wanted to
> play. This is a project I plan to continue to put effort into for a long time.

### Design philosophies

Two other main design philosophies for AtomsPast

The second main goal of AtomsPast is to be as affordable as possible. If you already play
tabletop games, you will most likely have most of what you need to play the game.

The third main goal is to be "fixable". Something that frustrates me is when an aspect of
a game is broken, or power creeped, or made useless for some reason. The way that AtomsPast
is being created should allow fast changes to point costs and power levels of Units.

## About AtomsPast

#### The basics of the game

In AtomsPast you are an extremely powerful Kon. Kon's can manipulate atoms to recreate
the objects the atom was a part of in the past, from simple elements to pieces of arcane
technology (learn more[link to lore]). What kind of Kon and what powers you poses are
represented by your deck of cards called a Spell Deck[link]. You use the cards in your
Spell Deck to cast powerful spells and alter the battle in your favor.

Your connection to the battlefield is through a lesser Kon who is your conduit to the
battle. To win the game you must destroy your opponents Kon. Your Kon knows a spell chosen
from your Spell Deck and can cast that spell repeatedly throughout the battle at a certain
power level [link to How Kon's work]. Generally you will pick a Spell[link] and base your
Units[link] and tactics on this Spell.

AtomsPast uses miniatures to represent your Warband, the rules you are reading now are embedded
in a Warband Builder. In the Builder you construct a Warband based on miniatures you own
to give them a set of rules for the game. Your Warband consists of your Kon Unit and as many other
Units you have the points and models to play with. A standard game of AtomsPast is 1500 points,
however you play how you want to.

#### What you need to play

- A good amount of six sided dice. Recommend 20 or more
- Miniatures to represent your Units and Kon
- A gridded battlemat (See [making your own battlemat])
- Spell Card deck (See [making your Spell Deck])
- A Warband List (generated through this app)

## How to play AtomsPast

### Game Phases

Players alternate taking turns in which they go through three main Phases: Spell Phase, Kon Phase,
and Battlefield Phase. Each Players turn starts with the Spell Phase and ends with the Battlefield
Phase.

#### Spell Phase

The Spell Phase consists of a Draw step, an Actions step, and an Additional Effects step performed
in that order.

- Draw step: At the start of the Players Spell Phase, they continue to draw cards until they have
  five cards in hand
- Spell Actions: The Player decides to perform any of the following three Actions in any order

  -- Place a Spell. Place a Spell into your casting zone and place dice representing it's AcTi[link]
  level

  -- Downtick Spells. The Player makes a Skill 3 roll with four dice (S3/D4 [see how dice work])
  and evenely distributes the value of the roll amoung the Spells they have placed in their casting
  zone. Check out the examples here [Link to examples]

  -- Cast Spells. The Player picks a Spell they have in the casting zone and rolls S3/D4 and adds
  the value of the roll minus the remaining AcTi of the Spell to see the results of the Spell. (See
  more about casting spells here)

- Additional Effects. These are effects from Spells or Abilities that happen after the main Spell
  steps. This step is ignored if there are no effects.

## Rule Clarifications and Examples

### Spell Actions

More information about the Spell Actions.

## Kon's

In the lore the Unit you pick for a Kon represents your conduit to the battlefield.
If the Kon is lost then the connection to the important battlefield is lost and will be easily won
by the enemy Kon.

### Rules

Kons have two AcTi’s to track, the AcTi for it’s Battlefield Actions, and the AcTi for the Kon Spell.
Both Downtick at the start of the Kon Phase (see below Kon Phase)

#### Picking a Kon

Each player only picks one model to be their Kon. There are no restrictions unless stated by another
rule as to what Unit the player can pick. This means that players can pick their Kon's right before
the start of the game if they want.

Make sure your Unit Card is clearly marked as the Kon. You could use a token, special die, or set the
Unit Card apart from the rest of your Unit's Cards.

#### Choosing your Kon's Spell

Your Kon’s Spell can be any Spell in your deck, simply take that Spell Card and remove it from your deck
placing it next to your Kon’s Unit Card with the Power Level clearly marked (usually with dice)

#### Kon Spells Power Level

Players may pick any Power Level for their Kon Spell. This Power Level represents how skillfully the
Kon knows how to cast the Spell. The Kon Spell is Cast with the same Casting Restrictions as the Spells cast
during the Spell Phase.

The Kon's Spell is eligible to be Cast when it's AcTi is zero or below. When calculating a Kon Spells
Effects, double the Power Level of the Kon Spell.

- The Power Level you pick does not change throughout the game (though Spell Effects might alter them)
- Kon Spells do NOT become Boosted if they are Downticked past zero, the Downtick is simply ignored

Example: Grafted Strike has an AcTi of 6, I have chosen it for my Kon Spell and set it next to my Kon's
Unit Card and chosen five as it's Power Level. The AcTi for my Spell would then start at, and after casting
return to 5. Whenever this AcTi reached zero and I could cast the Spell, I would calculate the Kon Spells
Effects at AcTi 10. In this case that means a Target Unit would be Altered +1MS and make a Melee Attack with
+4Md (10 - 6 = 4, Grafted Strike Cast with X =4, See Casting Spells)

### The Kon Phase

After the Spell Phase the Kon Phase starts. The Kon Phase consists of:

- Downticking the Kon's Unit AcTi and the Kon's Spell AcTi
- Picking a Kon Action to take (see below)
- Additional Effects. Resolve any effects stating they happen at the end

#### Kon Actions

Kon's can take one of three different Actions during the Kon Phase.

- Downtick either the Kon's Unit AcTi or the Kon's Spell AcTi
- Perform a Unit Action (see Unit Actions)
- Cast the Kon Spell if the Kon Spell AcTi is zero. The Kon Spell is Cast using double the Power Level
  chosen for it (see Kon Spell Power Level)

## Battlefield

The Battlefield is where Units clash

### Playmat

AtomsPast is best played on a playmat or board that has a 28x18 grid on it. Grid Spaces are typically 35mm.

If you are unable to play on a grid, you can use inches. A Unit's Move multiplied by 1.5 (Ex. My Orc Warrior has
a Move Stat of 3 grid spaces, or 4.5 inches)

### Models and Base Sizes

Because AtomsPast is made to work with as many models as it can, players should play in good faith and not try
and abuse base sizes or shapes for tactical advantage.

Unit's take up an agreed amount of Grid Spaces on the Battlefield. When moving a Unit for any reason, each part of
the model is restricted to the movement amount (Ex: Imagine a long dragon model that takes three grid spaces
length-wise, with a Move Stat of 4. Each grid space the Unit takes up is bound by that 4, so to pivot 90 degrees
would take this Unit's entire Move of 4 because that is how far the tail section would have to move.)

#### Rules of Thumb for Model Base/Grid Sizes

- Infantry/Single "Man" sized model = 1 Grid Space
- Calvary = 2 Grid Spaces, typically length-wise
- Large Sized single models = 2 or 4 Grid Spaces
- Huge Sized single models = 4 or 6 Grid Spaces.

AtomsPast allows for a lot of flexibility with Unit Sizes (Done in the Warband Builder). Please use best judgement
and the desire to have fun over min/maxing some base size situation.

### Units

Units is a blanket term for models that have a Unit Card from your Warband List. Each Unit has the following Actions
they can perform.

#### Unit Actions

- Move. A Unit moves as many grid spaces as it's Move Stat. Cost: AcTi 2
- Run. A Unit moves twice it's Move Stat. Cost: AcTi 3
- Attack. The Unit may choose to attempt a Melee or Ranged Attack (see Attacking). Cost AcTi 4
- Charge. The Unit chooses a target Enemey Unit that is in it's Line of Sight (see here). If the Unit is not engaged
  with any Enemy Units (see Melee Attacks and Engagement) it may perform a Move
  with a +1 modifier, and a Melee Attack with +1MD against the target Unit as a Charge Action. If the Unit cannot
  reach an Enemy Unit then it cannot choose a Charge Action. Cost: AcTi 4

When you pick a Unit to perform an Battlefield Action, you must “pay” the AcTi cost for that Action. This is done by
putting a dice or counter next to the Unit after it performed it’s Action. AcTi are explained further in the
Activation Timer section of the Rules. For example, Tom chooses his Orc Warrior to perform a Charge Battlefield
Action - he would move the Orc, resolve its Charge Melee Attack, and then place a dice showing a 4 to represent the
Charge Action cost (listed above). Unless other Effects change Tom's Orc Unit's AcTi, it will be able to choose
another Unit Action in 4 turns.

### Terrain

Terrain rules should be agreed upon by all players before the game starts. Below are modular rules for Terrain. They
are meant to be combined to represent any battlefield terrain.

- Higher Ground X. This represents the height of terrain on the battlefield. Terrain that does not have a Higher
  Ground value counts as Higher Ground 0.

  -- The X here represents the height of the Unit on it, and also the amount of grid spaces to check for difference in
  height to grid spaces around it. Ie: flat ground (0) next to Higher Ground 4 would mean a Unit would have to Move 4
  to get from the flat ground grid space to the Higher Ground 4 grid space.

### Battlefield Phase

The Battlefield Phase has three steps

- Downtick all Friendly Unit's AcTi's by one
- Unit Actions. All Friendly Unit's that do not have AcTi on them can choose an Action to perform.
- Additional Effects

#### Unit's Attacking

Unit's can typically perform either a Melee Attack or a Ranged Attack. When you build your Units in AtomsPast you
will see what Attacks they can perform.

All Attacks follow the same steps

- Target Unit is within Line of Sight (see below) and in Range of the weapon

##### Melee Attacks

Melee Attacks check

## Line of Sight

Line of Sight or LoS is the imaginary line between two Units. For a Unit to be able to be in Line of Sight to
another Unit, there must be an imaginary line drawn between the two grid spaces the Units are occupying. If
there is no Terrain, Units, or other rule that blocks Line of Sight on every grid space this imaginary line crosses
through than the Unit's have Line of Sight to each other.

- There are many Rules that can alter Line of Sight.
- Perfectly diagonal LoS: the Player in control of the Attacking Unit chooses one side of the grid spaces to affect
  LoS. This is the choice for the entire drawn LoS, not on a space by space basis.
  For examples see Line of Sight Examples.

## Range

The Range is found by taking the shortest path from a grid space to another, typically used to check if Unit Attacks
are within Range of the Target Unit. Count grid spaces excluding the starting grid space, but including the Target
grid space.

Ranges for anything requiring LoS have to count the grid spaces the imaginary LoS line would cross.

# FOR LATER

# Rules I need to clarify and link to

- How Additional Effects are handled - I think just having them trigger in the order the player wants
  -- but what if there are Enemy Effects, do they trigger first, last, etc? - is a stack made?

Downticking - what that specifically means

along with this ^ is AcTi

Spell Effects - and how Spell Cards work -- like downticking and Boosting

I think I want the structure: Barebone Rules, In Depth Rules, Examples

# Examples

Moving and grid spaces - multi grid space models moving, do a long model and a square one
