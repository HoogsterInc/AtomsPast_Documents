# AtomsPast Rules

## Welcome to AtomsPast

> The goal of AtomsPast is to give you a sandbox to use any miniature you like and
> play a fun, tactical, and customizable game with your friends. This is a labor of love
> to meld my favorite aspects of other great games into something I personally wanted to
> play. This is a project I plan to continue to put effort into for a long time.

### Design philosophies

Two other main design philosophies for AtomsPast

The second main goal of AtomsPast is to be as affordable as possible. If you already play
tabletop games, you will most likely have most of what you need to play the game.

The third main goal is to be "fixable". Something that frustrates me is when an aspect of
a game is broken, or power creeped, or made useless for some reason. The way that AtomsPast
is being created should allow fast changes to point costs and power levels of Units.

## About AtomsPast

#### The basics of the game

In AtomsPast you are an extremely powerful Kon. Kon's can manipulate atoms to recreate
the objects the atom was a part of in the past, from simple elements to pieces of arcane
technology (learn more[link to lore]). What kind of Kon and what powers you poses are
represented by your deck of cards called a Spell Deck[link]. You use the cards in your
Spell Deck to cast powerful spells and alter the battle in your favor.

Your connection to the battlefield is through a lesser Kon who is your conduit to the
battle. To win the game you must destroy your opponents Kon. Your Kon knows a spell chosen
from your Spell Deck and can cast that spell repeatedly throughout the battle at a certain
power level [link to How Kon's work]. Generally you will pick a Spell[link] and base your
Units[link] and tactics on this Spell.

AtomsPast uses miniatures to represent your Warband, the rules you are reading now are embedded
in a Warband Builder. In the Builder you construct a Warband based on miniatures you own
to give them a set of rules for the game. Your Warband consists of your Kon Unit and as many other
Units you have the points and models to play with. A standard game of AtomsPast is 1500 points,
however you play how you want to.

#### What you need to play

- A good amount of six sided dice. Recommend 20 or more
- Miniatures to represent your Units and Kon
- A gridded battlemat (See [making your own battlemat])
- Spell Card deck (See [making your Spell Deck])
- A Warband List (generated through this app)

## How to play AtomsPast

### Game Phases

Players alternate taking turns in which they go through three main Phases: Spell Phase, Kon Phase,
and Battlefield Phase. Each Players turn starts with the Spell Phase and ends with the Battlefield
Phase.

#### Spell Phase

The Spell Phase consists of a Draw step, an Actions step, and an Additional Effects step performed
in that order.

- Draw step: At the start of the Players Spell Phase, they continue to draw cards until they have
  five cards in hand
- Spell Actions: The Player decides to perform any of the following three Actions in any order

  -- Place a Spell. Place a Spell into your casting zone and place dice representing it's AcTi[link]
  level

  -- Downtick Spells. The Player makes a Skill 3 roll with four dice (S3/D4 [see how dice work])
  and evenely distributes the value of the roll amoung the Spells they have placed in their casting
  zone. Check out the examples here [Link to examples]

  -- Cast Spells. The Player picks a Spell they have in the casting zone and rolls S3/D4 and adds
  the value of the roll to the remaining AcTi of the Spell to see the results of the Spell.
