# AtomsPast Rules

## Welcome to AtomsPast

> The goal of AtomsPast is to give you a sandbox to use any miniature you like and
> play a fun, tactical, and customizable game with your friends. This is a labor of love
> to meld my favorite aspects of other great games into something I personally wanted to
> play. This is a project I plan to continue to put effort into for a long time.

### Design philosophies

Two other main design philosophies for AtomsPast

The second main goal of AtomsPast is to be as affordable as possible. If you already play
tabletop games, you will most likely have most of what you need to play the game.

The third main goal is to be "fixable". Something that frustrates me is when an aspect of
a game is broken, or power creeped, or made useless for some reason. The way that AtomsPast
is being created should allow fast changes to point costs and power levels of Units and
more modular rules. I'm still trying to figure out how to have the Spell Cards be easily
fixable, but the solutions I've come up with are bigger projects that will get more
attention if AtomsPast gets enough resources. Until then Spell Cards will have a list of
adjustments in the Rulebook.

## About AtomsPast

#### The basics of the game

In AtomsPast you are an extremely powerful Kon. Kon's can manipulate atoms to recreate
the objects the atom was a part of in the past, from simple elements to pieces of arcane
technology (learn more[link to lore]). What kind of Kon and what powers you poses are
represented by your deck of cards called a Spell Deck[link]. You use the cards in your
Spell Deck to cast powerful spells and alter the battle in your favor.

Your connection to the battlefield is through a lesser Kon who is your conduit to the
battle. To win the game you must destroy your opponents Kon. Your Kon knows a spell chosen
from your Spell Deck and can cast that spell repeatedly throughout the battle at a certain
power level [link to How Kon's work]. Generally you will pick a Spell[link] and base your
Units[link] and tactics on this Spell.

AtomsPast uses miniatures to represent your Warband, the rules you are reading now are embedded
in a Warband Builder. In the Builder you construct a Warband based on miniatures you own
to give them a set of rules for the game. Your Warband consists of your Kon Unit and as many other
Units you have the points and models to play with. A standard game of AtomsPast is 1500 points,
however you play how you want to play.

#### What you need to play

- A good amount of six sided dice. Recommend 20 or more
- Miniatures to represent your Units and Kon
- A gridded battlemat (See [making your own battlemat])
- Spell Card deck (See [making your Spell Deck])
- A Warband List (start making your Warband)

## How to play AtomsPast

### Dice Rolling in AtomsPast

Almost all rolls done in AtomsPast are done on a Skill system. This system uses a Skill value and
a Dice/Damage value, often represented in the Rules as [S(value)/D(value)]. The Skill value is what dice values
will be counted into the total of the roll, any dice value that is equal to or less than the Skill value
is counted. The Dice value is how many dice will be used for the roll. Dice that are rolled but are greater
than the Skill value add one to the total result.

An example using a Melee Attack. A Unit with Melee Skill 3 (MS 3) and has Melee Damage 4 (MD 4) would make
a [MS 3/MD 4] attack roll for Melee Attacks. This means the attacking player would roll four dice and any
dice with value 3 or less gets counted for the value on the dice. Any dice with value greater than 3 will
add one to the pool.
Example roll with total values for MS 3/MD 4: dice values: 1, 3, 2, 6 = 7 (1 + 3 + 2 + 1). The 6 is greater
than the Skill level, so it adds just one. If this dice roll had been done by an extremely powerful MS 6 Unit,
the total of all the dice would represent the damage dealt by the attack (12).

### Activation Timers

Activation Timers ("AcTi" throughout most of the rules) represent the "cost" of various actions. To use AcTi's
in AtomsPast, simply put a dice with the AcTi value on or near the card or model. There are rules below for when those
dice get "Downticked". Typically the player will have to plan their tactics around AcTi.

- AcTi: An Activation Timer placed on a Unit or card to represent the amount of time or power needed to perform an
  Action

- Downtick: To "Downtick" an AcTi, simply subtract 1 from the AcTi and change the dice tracking the AcTi accordingly.
  Ex: Orc Warrior has AcTi 2, at the start of the Battlefield Phase all friendly Units and Effects Downtick one. The
  Orc Warrior now has AcTi 1. If nothing changes for the Orc Warrior, next turn his final AcTi will be removed and
  they can pick a Action to perform.

Units and Kons both Downtick at the start of their respective Phases (Battlefield and Kon). Spells are Downticked by
Channeling. More detailed rules for Units, Kons, and Spells are below.

## Spells

In AtomsPast the grisly reality of magic that alters flesh and powers arcane technologies are
represented mostly by the Spells you choose to take into battle. Spells in AtomsPast often have
an X variable in them that represents how powerfully the Spell is cast. This allows for flexibility
with how powerfully you would like a Spell to occur.

Consider this quick example: Spell Z = AcTi Cost 5, "Target Unit performs a Melee Attack with +X MS".
This Spell gives our Unit a "free" Action (Melee Attack) performed when the Spell is cast, and anything above the Casting cost of 5
adds to the Unit's Melee Skill for this Melee Attack.
In the game, perhaps you just really need a Unit to
finish another Unit off, you might try to just get the casting cost paid for. Or maybe your Unit
has very low MS, so you Channel your spell multiple times to insure a potentially lethal hit.

The goal with Spells in AtomsPast is to give you powerful tools to use tactically with planning ahead.

### Spell Rules

Each Player starts the game with a 50 card Spell Deck.

Players Cast and Channel Spells with [S3/D4] rolls

Players each have a "Casting Zone". The Casting Zone is the area a player is lining up their Spells
that have been placed. These Spells can then be Channeled or Cast. Spells in a players Casting Zone
should be in a row, and easily visible to their opponents.

#### Building Your Spell Deck

To create a Spell Deck, you pick any amount of different Spells until your deck has 50 cards.
Spells have a Knowledge value which tells you how many copies of that Spell you can include in
your Spell Deck.

- Deck's must have 50 cards.

#### Spell Phase

The Spell Phase consists of a Draw step, an Actions step, and an Additional Effects step performed
in that order.

- Draw step: At the start of the Players Spell Phase, they continue to draw cards until they have
  five cards in hand
- Spell Actions: The Player decides to perform any of the following three Actions in any order

  -- Place a Spell. Place a Spell into your Casting Zone and place dice representing it's AcTi[link]
  level

  -- Downtick Spells. The Player makes a Skill 3 roll with four dice (S3/D4 [see how dice work])
  and evenly distributes the value of the roll among the Spells they have placed in their casting
  zone. Check out the examples here [Link to examples]

  -- Cast Spells. The Player picks a Spell they have in the casting zone and rolls S3/D4. Add
  the value of the roll minus the remaining AcTi of the Spell to see the results of the Spell. (See
  more about casting spells here)

- Additional Effects. These are effects from Spells or Abilities that happen after the main Spell
  steps. This step is ignored if there are no effects.

#### Spell Actions

- Place Spell: Pick a Spell card from your hand and place it near other cards in your Casting Zone

- Channel: Roll [S3/D4] and apply the result evenly in Downticks amoung the Spell you have in your
  Casting Zone. See examples

- Cast: Roll [S3/D4] and apply the Cast Result to a target Spell. See Casting a Spell.

##### Casting a Spell

Casting a Spell takes planning and effort, which in the game are represented by Placing Spells, Channeling
Spells, and then Casting them.

To cast a Spell, pick a target Spell in your Casting Zone. Then roll your Skill dice [S3/D4] and subtract
the AcTi the Spell had remaining. If there is more than zero AcTi remaining the Spell fails.

Roll dice, subtract remaining AcTi. Once AcTi is gone, you add the remaining value and resolve the spell
with X being that remaining value.

Take a Cast Result and subtract the remaining AcTi, the remaining amount is the X value of the Spell.

Cast Result:
Spells are Cast once a Cast Result has been calculated. Cast Results are the total power that went into
the Spell minus the remaining AcTi on the Spell. If the result is zero or greater the spell is cast and
the result is the X value of the Spell.

- For Spells cast from the Casting Zone,

Spells that have been Placed in your Casting Zone are eligible to be cast. See Spell Actions.

When a player Casts a Spell, they follow the directions on the card.

##### Boosting

Spells can be Boosted. Boosting Spells happens when an effect would Downtick a Spell that is already
at AcTi 0. Instead of this Downtick being ignored, a Boosted dice is placed next to the Spell that
count how many times the Spell would have been Downticked. There is no limit to how high you can Boost
a card.

When calculating the result of a Spell being cast, add the Boosted value to that result.

## Kon's

In the lore the Unit you pick for a Kon represents your conduit to the battlefield.
If the Kon is lost then the connection to the important battlefield is lost and will be easily won
by the enemy Kon.

### Kon Rules

Kons have two AcTi’s to track, the AcTi for it’s Battlefield Actions, and the AcTi for the Kon Spell.
Both Downtick at the start of the Kon Phase (see below Kon Phase)

#### Picking a Kon

Each player only picks one model to be their Kon. There are no restrictions unless stated by another
rule as to what Unit the player can pick. This means that players can pick their Kon's right before
the start of the game if they want.

Make sure your Unit Card is clearly marked as the Kon. You could use a token, special die, or set the
Unit Card apart from the rest of your Unit's Cards.

#### Choosing your Kon's Spell

Your Kon’s Spell can be any Spell in your deck, simply take that Spell Card and remove it from your deck
placing it next to your Kon’s Unit Card with the Power Level clearly marked (usually with dice)

#### Kon Spells Power Level

Players may pick any Power Level for their Kon Spell. This Power Level represents how powerfully the
Kon knows how to cast the Spell. The Kon Spell is Cast with the same Casting Restrictions as the Spells cast
during the Spell Phase but uses the Power Level times 2 as the Cast Result (Ex: Power Level 5 would be cast
as a result of 10).

The Kon's Spell is eligible to be Cast when it's AcTi is zero or below. When calculating a Kon Spells
Cast Result, double the Power Level of the Kon Spell.

- The Power Level you pick does not change throughout the game (though Spell Effects might alter them)
- Kon Spells do NOT become Boosted if they are Downticked past zero, the Downtick is simply ignored

Example: Grafted Strike has an AcTi of 6, Tom has chosen it for his Kon Spell and set it next to his Kon's
Unit Card. He chose five for it's Power Level. The AcTi for his Spell would then start at five, and after casting
return to five. Whenever this AcTi reached zero Tom could choose to Cast the Kon Spell as his Kon Action.
To cast the Kon Spell Tom would calculate the Kon Spells Effects at a Cast Result of 10 (Kon Power Level \* 2).
In this case that means a Target Unit would be Altered +1MS and make a
Melee Attack with +4Md (10 - 6 = 4, the Power Level minus the AcTi = Grafted Strike Cast with X =4,
See Casting Spells)

### The Kon Phase

After the Spell Phase the Kon Phase starts. The Kon Phase consists of:

- Downticking the Kon's Unit AcTi and the Kon's Spell AcTi
- Picking a Kon Action to take (see below)
- Additional Effects. Resolve any additional effects

#### Kon Actions

Kon's can take one of three different Actions during the Kon Phase.

- Downtick either the Kon's Unit AcTi or the Kon's Spell AcTi
- Perform a Unit Action (see Unit Actions)
- Cast the Kon Spell if the Kon Spell AcTi is zero. The Kon Spell is Cast using double the Power Level
  chosen for it (see Kon Spell Power Level)

## Battlefield

The Battlefield is where Units clash over various terrain, cities and towns.

### Playmat

AtomsPast is best played on a playmat or board that has a 28x18 grid on it. Grid Spaces are typically 35mm.

If you are unable to play on a grid, you can use inches. A Unit's Move multiplied by 1.5 (Ex. My Orc Warrior has
a Move Stat of 3 grid spaces, or 4.5 inches) is an approximation.

### Models and Base Sizes

Because AtomsPast is made to work with as many models as it can, players should play in good faith and not try
and abuse base sizes or shapes for tactical advantage.

Unit's take up an agreed amount of Grid Spaces on the Battlefield. When moving a Unit for any reason, each part of
the model is restricted to the movement amount (Ex: Imagine a long dragon model that takes three grid spaces
length-wise, with a Move Stat of 4. Each grid space the Unit takes up is bound by that 4, so to pivot 90 degrees
would take this Unit's entire Move of 4 because that is how far the tail section would have to move.)

#### Rules of Thumb for Model Base/Grid Sizes

- Infantry/Single "Man" sized model = 1 Grid Space
- Calvary = 2 Grid Spaces, typically length-wise
- Large Sized single models = 2 or 4 Grid Spaces
- Huge Sized single models = 4 or 6 Grid Spaces.

AtomsPast allows for a lot of flexibility with Unit Sizes (Done in the Warband Builder). Please use best judgement
and the desire to have fun over min/maxing some base size situation.

### Units

Units is a blanket term for models that have a Unit Card from your Warband List. Each Unit has the following Actions
they can perform.

#### Unit Actions

- Move. A Unit moves as many grid spaces as it's Move Stat. Cost: AcTi 2
- Run. A Unit moves twice it's Move Stat. Cost: AcTi 3
- Attack. The Unit may choose to attempt a Melee or Ranged Attack (see Attacking). Cost AcTi 4
- Charge. The Unit chooses a target Enemey Unit that is in it's Line of Sight (see here). If the Unit is not engaged
  with any Enemy Units (see Melee Attacks and Engagement) it may perform a Move
  with a +1 modifier, and a Melee Attack with +1MD against the target Unit as a Charge Action. If the Unit cannot
  reach an Enemy Unit then it cannot choose a Charge Action. Cost: AcTi 4

When you pick a Unit to perform an Battlefield Action, you must “pay” the AcTi cost for that Action. This is done by
putting a dice or counter next to the Unit after it performed it’s Action. AcTi are explained further in the
Activation Timer section of the Rules. For example, Tom chooses his Orc Warrior to perform a Charge Battlefield
Action - he would move the Orc, resolve its Charge Melee Attack, and then place a dice showing a 4 to represent the
Charge Action cost (listed above). Unless other Effects change Tom's Orc Unit's AcTi, it will be able to choose
another Unit Action in 4 turns.

#### Altered Units

When the word "altered" is used, it means a permanent effect placed on a Unit, such as an additional limb that
aids in melee combat. Kon's have near infinite amounts of ways they can enhance or weaken Units.

When a card says a Unit is "altered", that effect is permanent. Place the card altering the Unit beneath the Unit
card and track the change to it's stats.

### Terrain

Terrain rules should be agreed upon by all players before the game starts. Below are modular rules for Terrain. They
are meant to be combined to represent any battlefield terrain.

- Higher Ground X. This represents the height of terrain on the battlefield. Terrain that does not have a Higher
  Ground value counts as Higher Ground 0. If your Unit is on Higher Ground than target enemy Unit, your Unit gets
  a +1S modifier to it's attack rolls against the target Unit.

  -- The X here represents the height of the Unit on it, and also the amount of grid spaces to check for difference in
  height to grid spaces around it. Ie: flat ground (0) next to Higher Ground 4 would mean a Unit would have to Move 4
  to get from the flat ground grid space to the Higher Ground 4 grid space.

  -- Unit's with base sizes greater than one can only be placed for any reason where the difference in Higher Ground
  values is 1 or less. See examples

  -- The difference in Higher Ground values is calculated for Range by taking half the difference rounded down.
  See Ranges and Higher Ground.

- Difficult Terrain. Unit's moving through a Difficult Terrain grid space get a cumulative -1 to their Move stat for
  turn

- Obscuring Terrain. Unit's making Ranged Attacks through grid spaces that have Obscuring Terrain get a cumaltive -1
  to their RS (-1RS) per space.

- Line of Sight Blocking: Unit's cannot draw Line of Sight through this Terrain.

- Wall X. A grid space with a Wall is Line of Sight Blocking, and cannot be Moved on.

- Cover, Light and Heavy: Cover gives negative modifiers to Units attacking a target Unit within Range 1 of Light or
  Heavy Cover, as long as the LoS between Unit's passes over a grid space providing Cover.

  -- Light Cover modifier = -1S

  -- Heavy Cover modifier = -2S

- Dangerous Terrain X. Unit's moving through Dangerous Terrain take S6 DX damage. Example: if a Unit moved through
  two grid spaces of Dangerous Terrain 2, that Unit would take S6 D2 damage

Every grid space of terrain effects a Unit whose base size enters it, but only effects the model once per Action

### Battlefield Phase

The Battlefield Phase has three steps

- Downtick all Friendly Unit's AcTi's by one
- Unit Actions. All Friendly Unit's that do not have AcTi on them can choose an Action to perform.
- Additional Effects

#### Unit's Attacking

Unit's can typically perform either a Melee Attack or a Ranged Attack. When you build your Units in AtomsPast you
will see what Attacks they can perform based on their Weapons and Keywords.

All Attacks follow the same steps

- Target Unit is within Line of Sight (see below)
- Target Unit is within Range of the weapon/ability

##### Combined Attacks

Units that have no AcTi and are within Range 1.5 of each other can choose to perform a Combined Attack instead of
a normal Attack. To perform a Combined Attack, take the Damage/Dice of the first Unit and add half the second Unit's
Damage/Dice to the dice pool. Then make the attack roll with +1 Skill. Both Units must be able to make the Attack or
you cannot choose to perform a Combined Attack.

Example: Two Goblin Archers with RS 3, RD 3, RR 7 want to attack the same Unit. They both have no AcTi, and are within
range of an Enemy Footmen. The Footmen has a Shield that blocks two damage, so two separate low RS attacks will
most likely be ineffective. They choose to make a Combined Ranged Attack and roll [RS 4/ RD 4] to determine damage.
They both get an AcTi 4 for Attacking.

##### Melee Attacks

Melee Attacks check LoS and Range for any attacks made in your Unit's Melee Range.

Melee Attacks use the attacking Unit's Melee Skill and Melee Damage/Dice [MS/MD] to determine damage results.

##### Outnumbered

A Unit that is within two or more Enemy Units Melee Range, and those Enemy Units are not in Melee Range of other
friendly Units is considered Outnumbered. A Unit that is Outnumbered gives a +1MS modifier to Enemy Units performing
Melee Attacks against it.

##### Flanking Attacks

Units that have Enemy Units directly to each side of it (front/back, left/right), is considered Flanked. Units
attacking a Flanked Unit get a +1MD modifier to their Melee Attacks.

## Line of Sight

Line of Sight or LoS is the imaginary line between two Units. For a Unit to be able to be in Line of Sight to
another Unit, there must be an imaginary line drawn between the two grid spaces the Units are occupying. If
there is no Terrain, Units, or other rule that blocks Line of Sight on every grid space this imaginary line crosses
through than the Unit's have Line of Sight to each other.

- There are many Rules that can alter Line of Sight.
- Perfectly diagonal LoS: the Player in control of the Attacking Unit chooses one side of the grid spaces to affect
  LoS. This is the choice for the entire drawn LoS, not on a space by space basis.
  For examples see Line of Sight Examples.

## Range

The Range is found by taking the shortest path from a grid space to another, typically used to check if Unit Attacks
are within Range of the Target Unit. Count grid spaces excluding the starting grid space, but including the Target
grid space.

Ranges for anything requiring LoS have to count the grid spaces the imaginary LoS line would cross.

#### Ranges and Higher Ground

When calculating Range for models with different Higher Ground values, the Range is calculated by taking half the
difference in Higher Ground, rounded down. So a Unit with a sword attempting to attack and Archer on a grid space
with one Higher Ground value, would take 1 / 2 = .5 then rounded down = 0.

Example: A Soldier on flat ground (Higher Ground 0) with a Melee Range 1 sword attempts attacking a Archer who is on Higher
Ground 1. Horizontally the Archer is just one grid space away, so within range of the Solder's sword. When we take
into account the Higher Ground difference the Archer is still withing Range 1 (Higher Ground difference = 1. Range
modified by 1 / 2 rounding down (.5 rounded down to 0)). If the Archer was on Higher Ground 2, then the Soldier
would need a melee weapon with Melee Range 2 or greater to have Range for a Melee Attack against the Archer.

### Game Phases

Players alternate taking turns in which they go through three main Phases: Spell Phase, Kon Phase,
and Battlefield Phase. Each Players turn starts with the Spell Phase and ends with the Battlefield
Phase.

# FOR LATER

# Rules I need to clarify and link to

- How Additional Effects are handled - I think just having them trigger in the order the player wants
  -- but what if there are Enemy Effects, do they trigger first, last, etc? - is a stack made?

Effects - Like what are "Effects" and how do they work?

Spell costs - and how Spell Cards work -- like downticking and Boosting

I think I want the structure: Barebone Rules, In Depth Rules, Examples

# Examples

Moving and grid spaces - multi grid space models moving, do a long model and a square one

Line of Sight and Range examples

#### Terrain Examples

- Higher Ground examples for move and shooting: An example of a cliff in the game could
  be a line of Higher Ground 0 grid spaces, next to Higher Ground 7 spaces.

  -- How does this effect Ranges? Basically saying this is a way of having imaginary distance between grid spaces
  Off the top of my head: Ranges are effected by Higher Ground by half rounding down. So if a Unit is just 1
  higher than another, to Melee Attack would actually need to be Range 2 (one up and one horizontally) - With this
  halving rule, the Unit could still attack a Unit just 1 Higher.
  It sucks to add math, but I think this adds a lot to the customizable battlefield. Like Units on top a cliff
  shooting down Helm's Deep style from Higher Ground 6. Their Range is 9, so that would be 3 "down" and 6 left.
  this feels kinda realistic to me too

- Cover examples and pictures

Also how do multi - space models handle different Higher Ground values? I think a "as long as each grid space is
1 or less difference. cause then it could cascade down, like for models on a hill. ". Also Units can't move through
different height terrain or terrain they can't stand on, unless they have enough movement to get completely through
it. No horse knight models with the butt on Ground 0 and the head on Ground 4 on a successful charge

Multi-grid space Units can be occupying different higher ground values, however each grid spaces Higher Ground value
can't be more than 1 difference than those around it. For example a Unit with a base covering four grid spaces could
stand on a group of grid spaces where the top left = Higher Ground 1, top right = Higher Ground 2, bottom left =
Higher Ground 2, bottom right = Higher Ground 1. The Unit could not be placed at the examples location if the top
left grid space had a Higher Ground value of 0 as it would have a two HG value difference.

Every grid space of terrain effects a Unit whose base size enters it, but only effects the model once per Action

## Example written game turn

This is a written example of a game between Tom and Jerry. This example is going to go through the start of the Game
Until the end of turn three. The Units named won't include all their stats, just what needs to be used at that time.

Getting into specifics would make this an extremely long read, and the goal is to show the basic flow and main Rules
of the game, for more specific examples look in the Example section.

#### Pre-Turn 1

Tom wins the dice off for going first. He picks his Kon model, a Orc Boar Rider (Orc Kon), and picks the Spell
"Grafted Strike" at a Power Level of 5.

> Grafted Strike: AcTi 5  
> Alter target Unit +1 MS. Target Unit may perform a Melee Attack with +X MD.
> "Yes it's painful, but admit it - a giant scorpion tail is kinda cool to have, right?"

Tom sets a copy of Grafted Strike from his Spell Deck next to his Kon's Unit card with a dice set to 5 and marks on
his Kon card his Power Level of 5. Tom then
shuffles his deck and draws 5 Spell Cards. He picks two of those Spells to place in his Casting Zone and marks the
appropriate AcTi for them.

Jerry now follows the same steps, picks a Elf Riflemen for his Kon (Elf Kon), and "Bone Explosion" at a Power Level
of 3.

> Bone Explosion: AcTi 4  
> Target friendly Unit takes [3S/D5] damage. If it is not destroyed roll [3S/D9] damage against target Enemy Unit in
> Range 1.5. If the target Friendly Unit was destroyed by the damage it took with this Spell, then roll [3 + X S/D9]
> damage against target Enemy Unit in Range 1.5

Jerry sets a copy aside like Tom did with Grafted Strike and puts a 3 for Power Level tracking and a Dice showing a 3
for the Spells starting game AcTi. Jerry then draws 5 Cards and places two of them in his Casting Zone.

Then the game moves to the Deployment Phase. Tom deploys all of his Units up to Range 3 from his board edge, then
Jerry does the same. Once Jerry is done it is time to begin Turn 1.

##### Turn 1

Tom moves to his Spell Phase, he decides to Channel the Spells he has in his Casting Zone. He rolls [S3/D4] and gets
a 2,3,1,5 = 7 (2 + 3 + 1 + 1 as the 5 is above Skill 3). He distributes the Downticks evenly but then has an remaining
Downtick. He chooses Spell A to get an additional Downtick. For his second and final Spell Action he chooses to place
another Spell in his Casting Zone.

Tom then moves to his Kon Phase. He downticks his Kon's AcTi for his Kon Spell from 5 to 4. He doesn't have a
Battle Actions AcTi to downtick for him yet, but that will change now as Tom picks a Battlefield Action of Run
for his Orc Kon. His Orc Kon has a Move of 4, so Tom moves him a total of 8 grid spaces for his Run.

# random thoughts

What if Channeling is [S4/D4] and casting is [S3/D4]? It kinda makes sense in a way and incentivized the planning
more spells - or maybe channel 3 cast 2?...

- what I like a lot about this is that it incentivizes the placing of spells ... but that is also kinda incentivezed
  by just the timing aspect and casting costs right? In that way this makes the game a lot more dependent on that roll
  -- a diff of 4-16 vs 4-12 with the extra pip side being available, 66% pip values vs 50% pip values with that extra 16
  being 4 whole ticks... it's a lot

- deciding NO on this for now. If placing spells and doing more planning becomes an issue it can be looked at again
